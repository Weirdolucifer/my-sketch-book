			Hold the center of the printed image right up to your nose. It should be blurry. Focus
			as though you are looking through the image into the distance. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Very slowly move the image away from your face until the two squares above the image turn into
			three squares. If you see four squares, move the image farther away from your face until you see three squares. 
			</p>
				<p>
				If you see one or two squares, start over!When you clearly see three squares, hold the page still, and the hidden image 
				will magically appear. Once you perceive the hidden image and depth, you can look around the entire 3D image.

			If you are among those people who are mystified by moods, new research offers hope.
			A new study shows that certain types of reading can actually help us improve our sensitivity IQ. 
			</p>
			<p>
						To find out how well you read the emotions of others, take the Well quiz, which is based on an assessment
						tool developed by University of Cambridge professor Simon Baron-Cohen.

			A large crowd gathers outside the Verona Arena in Italy, with eager fans queuing to watch the performance of
			Jordan (Ranbir Kapoor), a rock musician. Despite being mobbed, Jordan manages to escape and reach the arena.
			</p>
			<p>
			He shows a complete disregard for his fans, storms onto the stage in a fit of rage and starts strumming angrily on his guitar.
			A flashback reveals the story of Jordan, whose real name is Janardhan Jhakar a.k.a. JJ, a simple Jat boy from, Delhi
			</p>
				<p>
			He is a student at Hindu College who dreams of becoming an international star, and this dream is often laughed at by his friends and 
			class mates. Khatana(Kumud Mishra), the canteen owner, tells JJ that the only way a meaningful melody can be produced is by undergoing
			trauma via a heartbreak.

			Instincts are inborn complex patterns of behavior that exist in most members of the species, and should be distinguished from reflexes,
			which are simple responses of an organism to a specific stimulus, such as the contraction of the pupil in response to bright light or the
			</p>
			<p>
			spasmodic movement of the lower leg when the knee is tapped. The absence of volitional capacity must not be confused with an inability to
			modify fixed action patterns.
			</p>
			<p>
			For example, people may be able to modify a stimulated fixed action pattern by consciously recognizing the point of its activation and simply
			stop doing it, whereas animals without a sufficiently strong volitional capacity may not be able to disengage from their fixed action patterns, once activated.</p>
